1.Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters
(hours and rate).
Enter Hours: 45
Enter Rate: 10
Pay: 475.0

2.Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and
1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is
between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:

Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F

#1 problem
print('Good morning!')
print('How are you feeling?')
feeling = input()
print('I am happy to hear that you are feeling ' + feeling + '.')
print('Good afternoon!')
print('How are you feeling?')
feeling = input()
print('I am happy to hear that you are feeling ' + feeling + '.')
print('Good evening!')
print('How are you feeling?')
feeling = input()
print('I am happy to hear that you are feeling ' + feeling + '.')


2. Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the
user enters `done`. Once `done` is entered, print out the total, count,
and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error
message and skip to the next number.

Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: bad data
Invalid input
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: done
16 3 5.333333333333333
